# Prosper-Loan-Dataset-Exploration

## Introduction
The data set I have chosen is the **Loan Data from Prosper**. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Objective
My goal is to investigate the performance of the loan; the current status, profits and return on investments. we would be investigating various trends and factors which may be responsible for high performance or failure of loans.

## Process

1. import my libraries and gather my dataset
2. carry out visual and programmatical assesment of the dataset
3. carry out some data wrangling
4. carry out some exploratory and explanatory visualization
