# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

This data set consist of information on loans given out by Prosper (www.prosper.com), a loan company in the United states of America. The Loan records contained in this data set began from 2005 to 2014, and contains records of 113,937 loans in total. 
I carried out preliminary cleaning and wrangling, as well as exploratory visualization on the dataset, before going further to generate insights through explanatory visualization. 



## Summary of Findings
Some of the things i found out from the datasets where:
1 Most of the listings are assigned with the creadit rate 'C', and very few listing were marked as 'Unknown' (U)
2 A lot of people are interested in short term loans. this could be as a result of the accrued interest rate or it may not be enough time to pay back.
3 Most people that borrow money from Prosper loans live in Carlifonia, followed closely by Texas and then florida. this is understandable because carlifonia has the highest population in the united states, followed by Texas and then Florida. North Dakota has the smallest population in that list so again, it is understandable that the least number of borrowers live there.
4 Prosper loans gets more estimated return on the loans from high end careers (like professionals, executives, etc) than those with low paying jobs. in the future, prosper loan ,may consider giving out loans more to this set of perople for better return on investment.
5 there is a strong relationship between the borrower annual percentage rate and the borrower rate. prosper loans may consider giving out more medium term and long term loans as tehy will generate more APR for them.



## Key Insights for Presentation

1 For the presentation, I focus on The records I am interested in for this analysis are:loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and borrower state
2 i used a bar plot to visualize the distribution of bar plot
3 I used pie chart to show the distribution of long terms 
4 I used scatter plot to show the relationship between Borrower APR and Borrower rate
5 i used a line plot to show the distribution of  borrower APR over time
